\chapter{\label{a:hints}Hints}

\begin{itemize}


	\item Learn about running latex and bibtex -- how many times, and in what order!

 \item Examine the .tex file to see how things are done. Note that it's convenient to use the "include{}"
syntax for chapters, so you can check formatting quickly, without processing the entire thesis.

	\item It's a good idea to establish a convention for referencing items, e.g. perhaps "e:..." for
equations, "f:..." for figures, "t:..." for tables, "c:..." for chapters.


	\item Be sure to put the "label" commands inside figure captions. Otherwise (sometimes) cross-referencing will be mixed up.
	
	\item Note the short-form figure caption, which appears in the list of figures.  (Do this work early because it's a pain later!)
	
	\item If you're finding weird cross-referencing results, clean out your .aux and similar files and start over.

 	\item Graphics can be tricky. Do some tests early on, so you'll learn whether your LaTeX setup
    handles the graphs you make.
