<p>Dalhousie's Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) places some fairly stringent
demands on the formatting of theses.  Students who use GUI-based document
preparation systems should be able to meet the demands without great
intellectual effort.  Unfortunately, this is not the case for students who use
LaTeX, which is not designed to let writers manipulate formats easily.  This
poses a problem, because switching from LaTeX to a GUI-based system is not a
sensible option for students whose theses contain significant mathematical
notation.</p>

<p>To ease the burden, Dalhousie students and faculty members have developed a
set of LaTeX style sheets. The present website provides one of these,
<code>ocethesis.cls</code>, and its associated bibtex style sheet,
<code>ocethesis.bst</code>.  (These style sheets also support Honours theses;
see the <code>mythesis-honours-coop.tex</code> file provided here.)</p>

<p>See the <a
    href="http://dankelley.github.io/dal-oce-thesis/installation.html">
    Installation</a> link for installing <code>dal-oce-thesis</code>, and the
<a href="http://dankelley.github.io/dal-oce-thesis/usage.html">Usage</a> link
for how to use it.</p>

<p><b>Authors</b> Many people at Dalhousie have contributed to this latex style sheet. The
version under discussion here is maintained by Dan Kelley (Department of
    Oceanography). A version with similar ancestry is maintained by members of
        Dalhousie's Faculty of Computing Science; for more, visit <a
