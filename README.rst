Background
----------

Dalhousie's Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) places some fairly
stringent demands on the formatting of theses.  Students who use
GUI-based document preparation systems will be able to meet the
demands without great intellectual effort.  Unfortunately, this is not
the case for students who use LaTeX, because that system is not
designed to let writers manipulate formats easily.  (Switching from
LaTeX to a GUI-based system is not a sensible option for students
whose theses contain significant mathematical notation.)

To ease the burden, Dalhousie students and faculty members (working
without help or support from FGS) have developed a set of LaTeX style
sheets. The present website provides one of these, ``ocethesis.cls``,
which is based closely on the Department of Computer Science
``dalcsthesis.cls`` style file.  (The latter is so well described at
[http://users.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/dalcsthesis/](http://users.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/dalcsthesis/)
that any sensible reader of the present document will follow the
link.)

Contents of this directory 
--------------------------

This directory contains the Dalhousie Oceanography thesis LaTex style
(``ocethesis.cls``), two bibliography style files (``ocethesis.bst``
and ``ocethesisbib.sty``), a sample LaTeX file (``mythesis.tex``), and
a sample bibliography file (``literature.bib``).

It seems that the style sheet satisfies the FGS rules as of early
2007. However, these rules are a moving target, so it seems certain
that further changes to the style files will be required at some
point. The whole purpose of this website is to facilitate this
development.  The reader is cautioned, however, that changing LaTeX
style sheets is *not* for the faint of heart.

Using the style file
--------------------

Your first step should be to try to run the sample file named
``mythesis.tex`` on your machine. (If you don't know how to run a
LaTeX file, you'll need to learn that from another source. Luckily,
LaTeX is the *lingua franca* of mathematically-inclined technical
writing, so many resources are available.)

Note that this sample file uses a figure, in the file
``figure1.pdf``. You'll need to find out how to work with whatever
type of figures your software creates. Do that and test it with this
sample file, before going on. This will be the biggest decision you'll
have to make. The simplest scheme would be to chat with another
student who uses similar software to make figures.

Once you've got it working with figures, you should start changing
some of the blocks in which definitions are given for the thesis
title, etc. Then it will be time to start adding lines to include your
various chapters and appendices. At that stage -- which should be
within an hour of your first experiment -- you'll be working on your
thesis, and you won't have to think about the format again!

Notes
-----

1. The margins are 0.05 inches wider than the width specified by the
   Faculty of Graduate Studies.  This is to avoid problems that arise
   by slight displacements in different printers.

Known errors in this version
----------------------------

1. Cross-references to appendices, such as in the first line of the
   *Hello* section of ``mythesis.tex``, fail on my (OS X system), but
   seem to work on PC systems.

2. As of March 2009, FGS requested that entries in the table of
   contents be in an upper-case font.  However, they relaxed this
   requirement after I explained that I had worked for a morning
   trying to do this, with no luck, and that our department had
   submitted dozens of theses in the format provided by this package.
   (In case they make the request again, a hint: the ``tocloft``
   package should be able to handle this, but it seems not to, at
   least in my trials.  There is an issue of where to put the
   ``usepackage`` command, I think.)
