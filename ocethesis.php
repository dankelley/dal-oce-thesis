<div class="title">LaTeX style file for Oceanography theses</div>
<div class="author">Dan Kelley 2010-01-04</div>

<h1>Background</h1> 

<p> Dalhousie's Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) places some fairly stringent
demands on the formatting of theses, but they provide little in the
way of help in meeting these demands. Students who use GUI-based
document preparation systems will find the rules to be annoying, but
easy to obey. That is not the case for students writing more
mathematical or technical theses, who tend to use LaTeX. </p>

<p>To ease the burden, students and faculty at Dalhousie have
developed a set of LaTeX style sheets. These have been in continual
development for a couple of decades, so they have passed through many
hands. </p>

<p> The present version of <span class="filename">ocethesis.cls</span>
is based very closely on the Department of Computer Science <span
class="filename">dalcsthesis.cls</span> style file, which is so well
described at <a
href="http://users.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/dalcsthesis/">http://users.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/dalcsthesis/</a>
that any sensible reader of the present document will follow the
link. </p>

<h1>Instructions for using the style sheet</h1>

<p>First, download <a href="ocethesis_<?php echo
$version;?>.zip">ocethesis_<?php echo $version;?>.zip</a> and unzip
it. Enter the directory that is thus created. There, you will see an
example thesis file <span class="filename">mythesis.tex</span> (which
uses separate files for chapter 1, etc.). You should be able to run
LaTeX on this file. If not, there is a problem that you will have to
solve before proceeding any further. Once latex runs, you should run
bibtex, to link the citations. Then run latex two more times, to
resolve the cross-links. The result should be a nicely formatted
thesis, but one with some pretty odd content. The title will be
<i>(Insert title here)</i>, and so on. This is placeholder text,
chosen so that you can easily locate it in the <span
class="filename">mythesis.tex<//span> file.</span>

<p>The second step is to start modifying the placeholder text in <span
class="filename">mythesis.tex</span> (or, better, a copy of this
file), and to start changing the placeholder text. Also, start adding
your references to the bibliography file, <span
class="filename">literature.bib</span>.</p>

<p>Note that this sample file uses a figure, in the file <span
class="filename">figure1.pdf</span>. You will need to find out how to
work with whatever type of figures your software creates. Do that and
test it with this sample file, before going much further, since you
will be able to save a lot of time by deciding on figure format from
the start.  It is a good idea chat with another student who uses
similar software to make figures.</p>

<p>In ten minutes, you should be well on your way. Many students find
it helpful to put chapter content in separate files, as in the
example, so that you can comment out chapters you are not actively
working on. There are loads of other tricks, too -- consult with other
latex users. The good thing is that you <i>should</i> not have to
worry about formatting.</p>

<h1>Known errors in this version</h1>

<ul>

<li> Something is wrong with appendices. Cross-referencing seems not
to work, and the appendices are not automatically entered into the
table of contents. See the example file <span
class="filename">mythesis.tex</span> for a workaround for the table of
contents. Unfortunately, there is not yet a solution for
cross-referencing; you will have to write e.g. <tt>(see appendix
A)</tt> instead of <tt>(see appendix~\ref{appendix-name})</tt>

</ul>

<h1>Changes from previous versions</h1>

<ul>

<li>Version <span class="filename">0.8</span> (released 2010-01-04) is
as <span class="filename">0.7</span> except for two changes that
should decrease the likelihood of excessive whitespace.  The first
change, in the <span class="filename">ocethesis.cls</span> file, is to
alter the spacing before and after all section headings is adjusted,
to decrease the incidence of excessive whitespace that can occur near
unbreakable items.  The second, in the <span
class="filename">mythesis.tex</span> document, is to use the
<tt>\raggedbottom</tt> command, to move excessive space to the page bottom.

<li>Version <span class="filename">0.7</span> (released 2009-03-30) is
as <span class="filename">0.6</span> except that M.Sc. and Ph.D. are
now abbreviated MSc and PhD, and the flexibility of spacing before and
after section headings is adjusted to reduce the chance of ugly
whitespace in other parts of the document.

<li>Version <span class="filename">0.6</span> (released 2008-09-02) is
as <span class="filename">0.5</span> except that
the Dedication and List of Symbols show up.

<li>Version <span class="filename">0.5</span> (released 2008-07-16) is
as <span class="filename">0.4</span> except that
the <span class="filename">\examiner{}</span> works for MSc.

<li>Version <span class="filename">0.4</span> (released 2008-02-18) is
as <span class="filename">0.3</span> except that
the <span class="filename">appendix</span> package is used to get
correct cross-referencing.  Note that it seems that this must be
high up in the inclusion list, so it is put at the top in the
 example file.

<li>Version <span class="filename">0.3</span> is as <span
class="filename">0.2</span> except that the margin spacing is more
correct. (A unix diff patch to <span
class="filename">dalcsthesis.cls</span> is <a
href="patch-to-0.3">here</a>.)

<li>Version <span class="filename">0.2</span> is as <span
class="filename">0.1</span> except that the chapter and section
headings are modified.

<li>Version <span class="filename">0.1</span> is as <span
class="filename">dalcsthesis.cls</span> except that (a) the page
height is adjusted to make the margin below the page number be 1/2
inch, (b) upper/lower case is used in titles, (c) line breaks are
changed in some boilerplate text (e.g. "Submitted in partial
fulfillment")

</ul>

<h1>Rules on the writing</h1>

<p>You should consult with the Faculty of Graduate Studies on rules
regarding the writing.  Having said that, here are a few hints:</p>

<ul>

<li>The first sentence of each figure captions are to be used in the
list of figures.  In LaTeX, the material for the list of figures is
given in square brackets, prior to the curly-bracketed caption.  You
can save yourself a lot of time by getting this right at the start.
Note that the sentences that appear in the list of figures should be
short and simple.  (Some writers use non-sentences, e.g. they might
write <tt>\caption[Sampling array.]{Sampling array.  Top panel: plan
view of sampling array, with instrument types as listed in the legend.
Bottom panel: diagram of an individual instrument.}</tt>

</ul>
